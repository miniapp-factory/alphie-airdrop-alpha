```
I want to create an autonomous agent app called "Alphie Airdrop Alpha" that has bright, vivid and dynamic UX/UI design using a cute pixar or disney like interface react that is highly interactive and colorful for new users to crypto, it also scans X.com and the internet for legitimate airdrop related alpha/information, promotions, NFT mints and more and then posts it to an X account as well as/or posts it inside of its app where you can ask it questions and have it manage portfolio tasks, execute trades/swaps for you as well. 
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

#### I want to create an autonomous agent app called "Alphie Airdrop Alpha" that has bright, vivid and dynamic UX/UI design using a cute pixar or disney like interface react that is highly interactive and colorful for new users to crypto, it also scans X.com and the internet for legitimate airdrop related alpha/information, promotions, NFT mints and more and then posts it to an X account as well as/or posts it inside of its app where you can ask it questions and have it manage portfolio tasks, execute trades/swaps for you as well.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` exported values to match the new app name and purpose.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo you want to generate (size and detailed description).  

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I need to create a new file for the logo description.  
Please add the following file to the chat:

```
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
```

Once that file is added, I can provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
